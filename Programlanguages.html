<h2>Program languages</h2>
A computer doesn’t understand instructions in the usual languages like English or Hindi, rather it accepts inputs of a certain type only. These inputs are known as the computer language or the machine language. The machine language is entirely different than the ones we use. But the machine language can’t be used always. It is too simple to easily and conveniently denote all the information that a computer processes.

Thus we have developed languages that can be used to write instructions in, instructions that the computer can easily understand. These languages are like the machine language but are a little more complex than it. Thus it becomes possible to feed instruction into a computer with the help of the programming languages.

<h2>Programs</h2>
A program is a set of instructions that is intended for a special purpose. For example, let us say that you want your computer to create a recipe for the sweetest cake in the world. In order to do this, you will have to tell the computer what to do first. You will have to tell the computer what a cake is, or what a recipe is! The set of instructions that you want the computer to follow or know forms a program.

The language in which these instructions are fed to the computer form the programming languages. These programming languages are converted into the machine language inside the computer. Remember that the computer can only understand the machine language or the binary language as it is also known. Binary language is also a programming language but it is too simple to be used for the complicated calculations that are to be done.

<h2>Assembly level Languages</h2>
The languages that the computer can understand but are more complex than the machine language or the binary language. Some examples of the assembly level languages are FORTRAN, COBOL, C, Python etc. Now that we have established that the computer can only understand the machine language and not any other, the question arises that how does the computer understand these assembly languages? The answer is that we convert these programming languages into the machine language. The part of the computer that does it is known as the compiler.

<h2>Questions on the Concept</h2>
Let us see some examples that may be asked on these topics.

Q 1: Out of the following options, one doesn’t belong. Pick the one that doesn’t

A) Interpreter          B) Translator            C) Compiler             D) Debugger

Answer: Let us look at each option. Selecting options at random is not the correct strategy for the exams. So an interpreter in terms of the computer knowledge is a program that can analyze and execute a program line by line. For example, you have written three lines in the compiler. The lines will be in the assembly level language. The compiler is a program that runs these lines or in other words executes the instructions in these lines directly without converting them to the machine language.

With that in mind, we realize that option A has to do with the programming languages. Similarly, the compiler is that program which converts a given set of instructions into the machine language. The debugger is also a program that finds and removes “bugs” from a program. Bugs are errors that occur in a program while writing the code using a given programming language. Thus all the three options are related to the programming languages. The option B seems to be the one that doesn’t fit here. So the answer is B i.e Translator.
